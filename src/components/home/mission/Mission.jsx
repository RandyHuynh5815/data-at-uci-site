            Data@UCI aims to nurture a community of Anteaters exploring
            their place in an increasingly data-driven world. 
            Through workshops, professional panels, and speaker events, 
            we provide resources and a network for students to grow their 
            analytical skills and gain a deeper appreciation for data 
            â€” helping them to succeed in college and in their careers. 
            We are a student-run organization ultimately dedicated to the 
            UCI and larger Orange County communities.
